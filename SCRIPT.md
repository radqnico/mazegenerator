# MazeGenerator Showcase Video Script (10 Minutes)

| Timestamp | Visuals & Actions | Narration & Key Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 00:00 - 00:30 | Cinematic flyover of a finished maze at sunset, slow zoom on logo overlay. | "Welcome to MazeGenerator, the Paper plugin that lets you build massive mazes without tanking your TPS. In the next ten minutes, I will play the role of a server admin showing you what players experience and how we keep everything running smoothly behind the scenes." |
| 00:30 - 01:20 | Cut to an empty flat-world hub; admin avatar stands near a control board. | Introduce MazeGenerator in plain language: maze-building in place, no world downloads, supports themed materials. Mention plugin folder structure (`plugins/MazeGenerator/`). |
| 01:20 - 02:10 | Show the plugins folder and `themes.yml` in a file viewer; overlay quick highlights. | Explain that the plugin ships with ready-to-go themes. Encourage viewers to copy the JAR into `plugins/`, restart, and review `config.yml`, `themes.yml`, and `messages.yml`. |
| 02:10 - 03:10 | Back in-game; admin runs `/maze` while looking at a flat field. UI shows chat message `job-started`. | Walk through the default command: `/maze`. Talk about how the plugin chooses your position, uses the default `desert` theme, and starts building right away. Emphasize non-blocking behavior; keep moving to show TPS remains smooth. |
| 03:10 - 04:20 | Time-lapse of maze assembling cell by cell; overlay status chat updates. | Narrate the incremental placement, highlight stream-friendly progress messages (`job-status`). Mention `/maze stop` if the admin needs an emergency halt. |
| 04:20 - 05:10 | Admin opens chat and types a themed command with tab-complete suggestions visible. | Showcase customization: `/maze mazeSizeX:51 mazeSizeZ:51 cellSize:2 wallHeight:4 hasExits:true additionalExits:1 themeName:forest`. Explain each key briefly and show the bigger footprint forming. |
| 05:10 - 06:00 | Showcase roofed maze; use spectator mode flying through corridors. | Demonstrate closed roofs and hollow walls: `/maze mazeSizeX:61 mazeSizeZ:61 cellSize:3 closed:true hollow:true themeName:mountain`. Mention hollow walls for block savings and closed roofs for dungeon vibes. |
| 06:00 - 06:50 | Switch to Nether world; run command anchored at coordinates. | Provide advanced example for multi-world admin work: `/maze world:world_nether x:100 y:80 z:-200 mazeSizeX:41 mazeSizeZ:41 themeName:snowy`. Highlight cross-world support and coordinate targeting. |
| 06:50 - 07:40 | Cut to config editor; zoom on `millis-per-tick`, `autotune`, and `chunk-loads-per-tick`. | Discuss performance controls. Explain how `millis-per-tick` sets the time budget, how autotune adapts, and that `chunk-loads-per-tick` plus `force-chunk-load` govern chunk safety. Encourage admins to start conservative, then raise values once confident. |
| 07:40 - 08:30 | Split-screen: left shows command line editing config, right shows in-game `/maze reload`. | Demonstrate the workflow: tweak `config.yml`, run `/maze reload`, watch confirmation message. Mention permissions `mazegenerator.maze` and `mazegenerator.reload` for staff roles. |
| 08:30 - 09:20 | Visual flowchart overlay explaining the generation pipeline; background footage of maze rendering. | Deliver technical insights accessible to all: explain that MazeGenerator carves a logical grid first, schedules block placements per chunk, and streams work in micro-batches. Mention weighted themes and optional hollow wall shell to cut block count by ~60%. |
| 09:20 - 09:50 | Show `/maze stop` aborting an active job, followed by `/maze` launching a quick demo. | Reinforce admin controls, show responsive stop/start cycle. Mention that status updates use `status-interval-jobs` from config. |
| 09:50 - 10:00 | Fade back to completed mazes, overlay call-to-action. | "Ready to craft your own labyrinth worlds? Grab MazeGenerator, tweak a theme, and share your builds. Drop questions in the comments, and subscribe for more Paper server automation tips." |
